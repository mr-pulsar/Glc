# Generative Artificial Intelligence

==>.Speech-to-Text (STT):Utilizing the SpeechRecognition library, we convert spoken language into textual data. Techniques such as Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) enhance the accuracy of transcribing spoken words.

==>.Translation: Leveraging the googletrans library, we implement language translation functionality. The Translator component efficiently translates the transcribed text from one language to another, ensuring linguistic accuracy.

==>.Lip-Sync Generation: Employing the Pydub and moviepy libraries, we synchronize translated audio with corresponding lip movements. This ensures that the translated speech aligns seamlessly with the lip movements, creating a natural and authentic visual experience.

==>.Text-to-Speech (TTS): Utilizing the gtts library, we convert the translated text back into spoken language. This TTS component produces a natural-sounding audio output that corresponds accurately to the translated text.
